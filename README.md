## Introduction

[**Click here to open APP**](https://bookstoreapp-645f9.firebaseapp.com/)

This project aims to set up a application featuring a list of great independent bookstores in Bay Area.
By Google Maps APIs, users are able to find a list of bookstores shown with markers on the map, hide the list, search a particular bookstore, get directions from any location to a particular listed bookstore by different travelling mode.
Each store has a information window to provide users information like storeâ€™s name, address, opening hours, image of the store, and number if checkins of the store.
